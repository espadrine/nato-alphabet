## Setup

To test it locally, you have two options:

### 1. Quickest option

Fast, but does not work with `https://[::1]:8765`,
and it will take port 80 (which may be already in use).

1. Install [Caddy][],
2. `make run`,
3. Open <https://localhost:8765> in your browser.

### 2. Industrial option

One more command, but it uses the industry-standard nginx / docker /
docker-compose toolchain, and volumes to ensure your edits impact the container
instantly.

1. Install [docker][] and [docker-compose][],
2. `make`,
3. `sudo docker-compose up`,
4. Open <https://[::1]:8765> in your browser.
